                    <p>This project seeks to develop a CubeSat lead by the Autonomous National University of Honduras (UNAH), in collaboration with the University of Costa Rica (UCR) and the University of San Carlos in Guatemala (USAC). This project is supported
                        by the Central American Integration System (SICA) which represents the institutional framework for Regional Integration in Central America.</p>
                    <p>Integration in Central America. As a region with high exposure to hydrometeorological extreme events over the last three decades, more than twenty occurred yearly in Central America, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. </p>
                    <p>In many of these disasters, many infrastructural facilities and communication services were severely damaged </p>

                            analysis that accounts for both exposures to hydrometeorological events and vulnerability which in turn accounts for societal factors such as susceptibility of the population, lack of coping and adapting capacities.</p>
